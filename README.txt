Copy the include and lib directories of SDL2 into the project folder. On Mac
you can just install them with 'brew install SDL2' and the folders will probably
be located in /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.8/include and
/usr/local/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.5/lib respectively. Then just type the make command
and launch life.

Press 'enter' to go into edit mode, where you can modify the grid by clicking.
Press enter again to play. There is a buffer of different game states so you
can roll back the simulation by pressing the back arrow.

You can also cycle the color of the cells by pressing 'c'.
